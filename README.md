# InstaCare - Finding the closest Hospital / Pharmacy in a single tap

This projects builds an *iPhone native application* to look up the closest hospitals (and other medical facilities) using the Foursquare API. 

We want this to showcase the importance of building an open documented-oriented database of points of interests. It would be also interesting to have for each POI an indicator about the accessibility for handicapped people.

## How to build the project

It's easy. You need a Foursquare account. Go to their [developer portal](http://developer.foursquare.com), get an API Client ID and add it in the FoursquareSingleton class file. You're ready to go. Don't forget to create the build schemes and you're ready to go. 

*Disclaimer* : It has only been tested on iOS6 with Xcode 4.5. This project won't be maintained.
